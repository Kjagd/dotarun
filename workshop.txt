If you liked Mario Kart / Crash Team Racing / Lego Racers you'll love this!

Get to the finish line faster than your opponents by using all the dirty tricks you can come up with.
Use your trusted force staff and the addional items and abilities you collect by finding the marked squares,
but be careful of the traps!

The map is 1v1-5v5 and the first team to win two laps wins the game.
