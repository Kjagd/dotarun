The best running game in existence, hopefully!

Hey all! 

Our first dota 2 mod is being created right here, so if anybody feels like pitching in, sending a PR or whatever, feel free to do so!

### Setting up

First of all you need to download the files to the correct location. Your git root should be at 

`...\Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota_ugc`

Please note that since git doesn't allow cloning into an non-empty directly, it will probably create a directory called dotarun,
and you will to need move the content of this folder one level up to dota_ugc. (Don't forget the .git folder!!)

#### Resources

The documentation for Dota 2 alpha tools aren't always the best, so here are some of the resources we are using.

[Valve's scripting overview](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dota_2_Workshop_Tools/Scripting)
[Dota2Modding subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dota2modding)
[Some introduction tutorials](http://yrrep.me/dota/)

[Trap inspiration](http://thristhart.github.io/techniques/dota/arrow-trap)

#### Tips
[Sublime text packages](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/Dota-2-Sublime-Packages)

To read all the KV-files in the game download gcfscape and open 

`...\Steam\SteamApps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\pak01_dir.vpk`

Now browse scipts/npc or whatever you need.
